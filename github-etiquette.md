A few GitHub rules:
=

- Keep file paths short and sensible.
- Don’t use funky characters and spaces in your file names, these cause trouble because of differences in Mac/Windows systems.
- Always pull before you push in case someone has done any work since the last time you pulled - you wouldn’t want anyone’s work to get lost or to have to resolve many coding conflicts
- Do not commit big chunks of code at once.
- Make sure the code you are writing makes sense(it's not spaghetti code), also make sure you 
  have added comments to explain difficult parts of your code to others.
